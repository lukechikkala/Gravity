# Gravity

A small-physics engine that will one day hopefully see the light of gravity.<br>
There is no intention to add wind/air and other factors.<br>
They wil probably be part of another program someday.

Currently, the program only renders a couple of squares organized in the shape of "L".

The program uses:<br>
* OpenGL
* GLFW

I did include Dear ImGui earlier, but removed it as I don't see a need for it at the moment.<br>
Perhaps when "real-virtual" gravity is actually added, I'll bring that back.
